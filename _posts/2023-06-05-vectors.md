When you have values for $x$, $y$, and $z$, you can describe a point in three dimensional space. Something like $(3, 5, 1)$ or $(0, -2,  6)$, for example. Now let's say you've got two points. Subtracting one from the other tells you not just the difference between them, but how you might get from one point to the other. In 3D math, this difference can be called a vector.

If you think of a vector as the difference between two points, you could say it has two properties: direction and length. A property it lacks, when considered on its own, is position. A vector can only tell you the direction and distance a point might change by, but only the point can tell you where it is.

Just like points, vectors can be added to and subtracted from one another. Vectors can also be multiplied and divided by real numbers, which changes their length. You can think of the vector as being scaled by the real number, so the real number is called a scalar.

Let's see what some textbooks have to say about points and vectors.

>"A vector refers to a quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction." [^Luna2012p4]

>"To mathematicians, a vector is a list of numbers. Programmers will recognize the synonymous term *array*. [^Dunn2011p31]

>"Geometrically speaking, a vector is a directed line segment that has *magnitude* and *direction*." [^Dunn2011p34]

>"A *scalar* is a quantity such as distance, mass, or time that can be fully described using a single numerical value representing its size, or its *magnitude*. A vector is a quantity that carries enough information to represent a direction in space, in addition to a magnitude." [^Lengyel2016p1]

>"Points represent locations in space, which can be used either as measurements on the surface of an object to approximate the object's shape (this approximation is called a *model*), or simply the position of a particular object. (...) Vectors, on the other hand, represent the difference or displacement between two points." [^VanVerth2016p33]

Cool. Let's write some code.

## Structure
On a practical level, the difference between a vector and a point comes down to interpretation and application. So in the code, I'll use a single `struct` to represent both. A `Vec3` will contain three `float`s and support these basic operations:
- index access to the member variables
- comparison
- addition and subtraction with another `Vec3`
- simple negation
- multiplication and division by a scalar

I'll also throw in some `static` definitions for known vectors. A vector of length zero is creatively called the *zero vector*. A vector of length one is called a *unit vector*, and I'll define the unit vectors for the $x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions in advance.

To start, let's just declare the basic structure:

```cpp
struct Vec3 {
    static Vec3 const zero;
    static Vec3 const unit_x;
    static Vec3 const unit_y;
    static Vec3 const unit_z;

// =============================================================================
    float x = 0.0f;
    float y = 0.0f;
    float z = 0.0f;

    [[nodiscard]] float & operator[](uint8_t i) { return ((&x)[i]); }
    [[nodiscard]] float   operator[](uint8_t i) const { return ((&x)[i]); }

// =============================================================================
    [[nodiscard]] bool operator==(Vec3 const &other) const;

// =============================================================================
    Vec3() = default;
    ~Vec3() = default;

    Vec3(float x, float y, float z);

    Vec3(Vec3 &&) = default;
    Vec3(Vec3 const &) = default;

    Vec3 & operator=(Vec3 &&) = default;
    Vec3 & operator=(Vec3 const &) = default;
};
```

And define what's required to start writing unit tests:

```cpp
Vec3 const Vec3::zero   { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };
Vec3 const Vec3::unit_x { 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f };
Vec3 const Vec3::unit_y { 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f };
Vec3 const Vec3::unit_z { 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f };

// =============================================================================
bool Vec3::operator==(const Vec3 &other) const {
    // If the absolute value of the difference between this.x and other.x is
    // less than the chosen float epsilon, then the x components of the two
    // vectors are the same. If all three hit this criterion, the vectors are
    // equal.

    return (
        std::abs(x - other.x) < epsilon &&
        std::abs(y - other.y) < epsilon &&
        std::abs(z - other.z) < epsilon
    );
}

// =============================================================================
Vec3::Vec3(float x, float y, float z) :
    x { x },
    y { y },
    z { z }
{ }
```

You might notice `epsilon` there, even though I haven't mentioned it yet. If you've ever had a floating point operation go awry, you probably know that even [comparing values can be tricky](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/). Originally, I had this `epsilon` set to `std::numeric_limits<float>::epsilon()`, which my toolchain has as just over `1.0e-7`. This proved too restrictive for even basic tests, so I opted for six places of precision instead.

```cpp
static float constexpr epsilon = 1.0e-6;
```

The first unit tests establish that we can access and manipulate `Vec3` member data as intended.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector structure", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    Vec3 const a(1, 2, 3);
    // Test accessing by member name
    REQUIRE_THAT(a.x, WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(a.y, WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(a.z, WithinAbs(3.0f, epsilon));

    // Test accessing by index
    REQUIRE_THAT(a[0], WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(a[1], WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(a[2], WithinAbs(3.0f, epsilon));

    Vec3 b(4, 5, 6);
    // Test modifying by index
    b[0] = b[0] * a[1];
    REQUIRE_THAT(b[0], WithinAbs(8.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE(b == Vec3{ 8, 5, 6 });
}
```

Before moving on to basic arithmetic, I'll add a helper function leveraging [Catch2's  generators](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/generators.md) so fresh, random vectors can be used each time the tests are run.

```cpp
#include <catch2/generators/catch_generators_random.hpp>

#include "brasstacks/math/math.hpp"

inline auto random_vec3(float const min = -1.0f, float const max = 1.0f) {
    return btx::math::Vec3(
        Catch::Generators::random(min, max).get(),
        Catch::Generators::random(min, max).get(),
        Catch::Generators::random(min, max).get()
    );
}
```

And since I'll want to try different random vectors when I can, I'll add this constant:

```cpp
static uint32_t constexpr TEST_REPEATS = 3u;
```

## Arithmetic
First, vectors need to know how to be added to and subtracted from one another.

```cpp
    [[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator+(Vec3 const &other) const;
    [[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator-(Vec3 const &other) const;

    [[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator-() const;

    Vec3 & operator+=(Vec3 const &other);
    Vec3 & operator-=(Vec3 const &other);
```

```cpp
Vec3 Vec3::operator+(Vec3 const &other) const {
    return { x + other.x, y + other.y, z + other.z };
}

Vec3 Vec3::operator-(Vec3 const &other) const {
    return { x - other.x, y - other.y, z - other.z };
}

Vec3 Vec3::operator-() const {
    return { -x, -y, -z };
}

Vec3 & Vec3::operator+=(Vec3 const &other) {
    x += other.x;
    y += other.y;
    z += other.z;

    return *this;
}

Vec3 & Vec3::operator-=(Vec3 const &other) {
    x -= other.x;
    y -= other.y;
    z -= other.z;

    return *this;
}
```

Vector addition should be commutative and associative, so the unit tests will check for that both via the arithmetic operators and the assignment operators.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector addition", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    for(auto i = 0u; i < TEST_REPEATS; ++i) {
        Vec3 const a = random_vec3();
        Vec3 const b = random_vec3();

        // Addition is commutative
        REQUIRE(a + b == b + a);

        // Addition is commutative via assignment
        Vec3 const c = a + b;
        Vec3 d = a;
        Vec3 e = b;
        REQUIRE((d += b) == c);
        REQUIRE((e += a) == c);

        // Addition is associative
        Vec3 const f = a + b + c;
        REQUIRE((a + b) + c == f);
        REQUIRE(a + (b + c) == f);

        // Addition is associative via assignment
        Vec3 g = a;
        Vec3 h = b;
        REQUIRE((g += b) + c == f);
        REQUIRE(a + (h += c) == f);
    }
}
```

Subtraction has to concern itself with negation, assignment, and the first useful case of a `static Vec3`.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector subtraction", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    Vec3 const a(0, 9, -3);
    Vec3 const b(2, -1, 6);
    Vec3 const c(-2, 10, -9);
    Vec3 d = a;

    REQUIRE(a - b == c);            // Basic operation
    REQUIRE(a + (-b) == c);         // Negation operator
    REQUIRE((d -= b) == c);         // Assignment operator
    REQUIRE(a - a == Vec3::zero);   // A vector minus itself is zero
}
```

## Vector Length
Given a three dimensional vector $\vec v$, the length of $\vec v$ is:

$$||\vec v|| = \sqrt((\vec v_x)^2+(\vec v_y)^2+(\vec v_z)^2)$$

Kinda looks like the Pythagorean theorem, doesn't it? You probably originally learned the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions as a means by which to complete a triangle. If you like, you could think of the two given legs of the triangle as the $x$ and $y$ components of a 2D vector. The "hypotenuse" you'd be calculating via the Pythagorean theorem is then the length of this 2D vector.

You could also look at it from the perspective of vector addition. If the two given legs of the triangle are themselves vectors, the sum of these vectors again produces something like a hypotenuse. Because vectors have no position, you'd have to draw them in a particular way to actually create a triangle, but the same idea holds.

In code, I've added two functions. The first returns the squared length of the vector. The second returns the true length, with a couple of tests to avoid the square root operation where possible.

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] inline float length2(Vec3 const &v) {
    return (v.x * v.x) + (v.y * v.y) + (v.z * v.z);
}

[[nodiscard]] inline float length(Vec3 const &v) {
    float length_squared = length2(v);

    // If we're dealing with the zero vector, return zero
    if(std::abs(length_squared) < epsilon) {
        return 0.0f;
    }

    // If it's a unit vector, skip the square root calculation
    if(std::abs(length_squared - 1.0f) < epsilon) {
        return length_squared;
    }

    return std::sqrt(length_squared);
}
```

The test cases for these two functions are pretty straight forward.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector length", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    // Test the unit vectors
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_x), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_y), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_z), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::zero),   WithinAbs(0.0f, epsilon));

    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(Vec3::unit_x), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(Vec3::unit_y), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(Vec3::unit_z), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(Vec3::zero),   WithinAbs(0.0f, epsilon));

    // Then three samples
    Vec3 a(6, 10, 1);
    float a_length = 11.70469991f;
    float a_length2 = 137.0f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a),  WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(a), WithinAbs(a_length2, epsilon));

    a = { 2, 9, 8 };
    a_length = 12.20655562f;
    a_length2 = 149.0f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a),  WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(a), WithinAbs(a_length2, epsilon));

    a = { 10, -10, 5 };
    a_length = 15.0f;
    a_length2 = 225.0f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a),  WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length2(a), WithinAbs(a_length2, epsilon));
}
```

## Vector Normalization
A vector is considered normalized when it has a length of one. This means the unit vectors are normalized by default, but everyone else may or may not be. There are some operations we'll work with later that can be made much more efficient if the vectors they're working with are normalized first, so this is an important function to have. In order to normalize a vector, you divide each component by the vector's length.

```cpp
Vec3 normalize(Vec3 const &v) {
    Vec3 result = v;

    auto const length = length2(v);

    // If we're working with the zero vector or a vector that's already
    // normalized, just return
    if(length < epsilon || std::abs(length - 1.0f) < epsilon) {
        return result;
    }

    float const length_recip = 1.0f / std::sqrt(length);

    result.x *= length_recip;
    result.y *= length_recip;
    result.z *= length_recip;

    return result;
}
```

Testing normalization inherently makes use of `length()` from above, too.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector normalization", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    // The unit vectors won't change
    REQUIRE(normalize(Vec3::unit_x) == Vec3::unit_x);
    REQUIRE(normalize(Vec3::unit_y) == Vec3::unit_y);
    REQUIRE(normalize(Vec3::unit_z) == Vec3::unit_z);

    // But these three will
    Vec3 a(-4, -3, -5);
    float a_length = 7.071067812f;
    Vec3 b(-0.5656854249f, -0.4242640687f, -0.7071067812f);
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE(normalize(a) == b);
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(normalize(a)), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));

    a = { -1, 1, 1 };
    a_length = 1.732050808f;
    b = { -0.5773502692f, 0.5773502692f, 0.5773502692f };
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE(normalize(a) == b);
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(normalize(a)), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));

    a = { 0, -4, 5 };
    a_length = 6.403124237;
    b = { 0.0f, -0.6246950476f, 0.7808688094f };
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE(normalize(a) == b);
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(normalize(a)), WithinAbs(1.0f, epsilon));
}

```

## Scalars
Finally, scalar operations will round out this `Vec3`. I'll add assignment operators within the `struct`:

```cpp
    Vec3 & operator*=(float scalar);
    Vec3 & operator/=(float scalar);
```

And regular operators without:

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator*(float scalar, Vec3 const &v);
[[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator*(Vec3 const &v, float scalar);
[[nodiscard]] Vec3 operator/(Vec3 const &v, float scalar);
```

With the definitions looking like this:

```cpp
Vec3 & Vec3::operator*=(float scalar) {
    x *= scalar;
    y *= scalar;
    z *= scalar;

    return *this;
}

Vec3 & Vec3::operator/=(float scalar) {
    x /= scalar;
    y /= scalar;
    z /= scalar;

    return *this;
}

// =============================================================================
Vec3 operator*(float scalar, Vec3 const &v) {
    return { v.x * scalar, v.y * scalar, v.z * scalar };
}

Vec3 operator*(Vec3 const &v, float scalar) {
    return { v.x * scalar, v.y * scalar, v.z * scalar };
}

Vec3 operator/(Vec3 const &v, float scalar) {
    return { v.x / scalar, v.y / scalar, v.z / scalar };
}
```

Since scalars change vectors' length, we'll be testing with `length()` as well as touching both the basic operators and assignment.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vector scaling", "[vectors][vector basics]") {
    // Test the unit vectors
    REQUIRE_THAT(length( 2.0f * Vec3::unit_x), WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(-2.0f * Vec3::unit_y), WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length( 0.5f * Vec3::unit_z), WithinAbs(0.5f, epsilon));

    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_x *  2.0f), WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_y * -2.0f), WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_z *  0.5f), WithinAbs(0.5f, epsilon));

    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_x /  2.0f), WithinAbs(0.5f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_y / -2.0f), WithinAbs(0.5f, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(Vec3::unit_z /  0.5f), WithinAbs(2.0f, epsilon));

    // Then three samples
    Vec3 a(6, 10, 1);
    Vec3 b(0, -1, 4);
    float a_length = 11.70469991f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(2.0f * a), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length,  epsilon));
    // Scalars via assignment operator
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a *= -2.0f), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a /= 2.0f), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    // Scalar multiplication distributes over addition
    REQUIRE(-1.5f * (a + b) == (-1.5f * a) + (-1.5f * b));

    a = { 2, 9, 8 };
    b = { -3, 1, 0 };
    a_length = 12.20655562f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(2.0f * a), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length,  epsilon));
    // Scalars via assignment operator
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a *= -2.0f), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a /= 2.0f), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    // Scalar multiplication distributes over addition
    REQUIRE(-1.5f * (a + b) == (-1.5f * a) + (-1.5f * b));

    a = { 10, -10, 5 };
    b = { 2, -5, 3 };
    a_length = 15.0f;
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(2.0f * a), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length,  epsilon));
    // Scalars via assignment operator
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a *= -2.0f), WithinAbs(2.0f * a_length, epsilon));
    REQUIRE_THAT(length(a /= 2.0f), WithinAbs(a_length, epsilon));
    // Scalar multiplication distributes over addition
    REQUIRE(-1.5f * (a + b) == (-1.5f * a) + (-1.5f * b));
}
```

## Conclusion
We've covered what a vector is and the first few things we're going to do with them. Next time will be a couple more vector-specific operations: the dot and cross products.
